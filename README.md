# thread-excercise

A Maven thread exercise project. Maven build has not been tested as initial commit only run in eclipse.

Main method read thread pool size first, which must be an integer. For example: 3

WorkerContainer, a thread pool singleton, holds the a list of WorkerSender threads which keep trying to obtain an integer from queue and send it.

Then the program reads a line of common separated integers into a queue. For example: 1,2,3,4,5,6

The SenderWorkers will read a number from the queue every 10 seconds. If there is exeception doing the work, it rolls back by putting the number back to queue.

Program can continue by typing enter.
Then the program reads a new line of integer and adding to queue, disregard of whether the queue is empty or not.

On the other hand, typing 'exit' will signal the threads to stop and close the program properly.
